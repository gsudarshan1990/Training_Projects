PR unifies the printing functionality of Rot3 to use the `Eigen::IOFormat` formatting, thus ensuring consistency.\r\n\r\nThe aim would be to help the user visually identify more easily what the rotation matrices are, as well as copy them into another language such as python.\r\n\r\nI've also\r\n1. updated the printing of `Pose3`, `NavState` and `Rot3` to provide default spacing when using the custom prefix string\r\n2. removed extra newlines by removing newlines in the `<<` overload\r\n3. removed `endl` in `<<` so as to avoid unnecessary buffer flushes.\r\n\r\nFor the below snippet,\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nPose3 p;\r\ncout << p << endl;\r\np.print();\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe previous format looked like this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# result of cout\r\n|1, 0, 0|\r\n|0, 1, 0|\r\n|0, 0, 1|\r\n\r\n[0, 0, 0]';\r\n\r\n# result of .print()\r\nR:\r\n[\r\n\t1, 0, 0;\r\n \t0, 1, 0;\r\n \t0, 0, 1\r\n]\r\n[0, 0, 0]';\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new format would give the output:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# result of cout\r\nR: [\r\n\t1, 0, 0;\r\n\t0, 1, 0;\r\n\t0, 0, 1\r\n]\r\nt: [0, 0, 0]'\r\n# result of .print()\r\nR: [\r\n\t1, 0, 0;\r\n\t0, 1, 0;\r\n\t0, 0, 1\r\n]\r\nt: [0, 0, 0]'\r\n```\n\n<!--
